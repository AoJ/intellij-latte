# Latte in IntelliJ IDEA / PhpStorm

[Latte](http://doc.nette.org/en/templating#toc-latte) templating language is part of [Nette framework](http://nette.org)
 and it's very nice! You should definitely use it.

This plugin aims to add suppors for this language into PhpStorm (or the whole IntelliJ platform).

## Features
* lexer, parser (internal)
* syntax highlighting
* code completion
* ... more to come

## Development

This plugin is in its early development phase, it's not complete at all and it will contain many bugs!
 Be careful if you decide to use it.

Please tell me what **features** you'd like in *Issues tab*.
